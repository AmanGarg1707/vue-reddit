# vue-reddit

A reddit frontend developed in [vuejs](https://vuejs.org) [CLI 4](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

Currently it is able to search, view subreddit, search a subreddit, view posts etc.

I will try to add more in the future.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration

Vue configuration can be edited in **_vue.config.js_**.
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Deployment

After running the build command, all the code for deployment will be stored in the dist folder - **dist\reddit**.
Just place the **reddit** folder in the root of your server and deploy. Path will be - **_www.yourdomain.com_/reddit/reddit.html**
